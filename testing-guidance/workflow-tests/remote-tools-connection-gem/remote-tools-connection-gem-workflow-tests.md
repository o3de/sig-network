# Remote Tools Connection Gem

This gem enables connection to the Editor from the Script Canvas and LuaIDE tools.Â  Created in an extensible way, this may eventually allow connection from new tools, but the following are tests for the initial needs/functionality of the gem

## Common Issues

*   Connection failure
*   Connection drop
*   Tool instability
