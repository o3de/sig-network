# Sig-Network RFCs
This is where RFCs that have been accepted by SIG-Network are kept.

## RFC Naming
RFC naming follows the pattern of:

```rfc-net-(YYYYMMDD)-(X)-(friendlyname)```

#### Notes
* RFC should be referred to as ```rfc-net-YYYYMMDD-X```, friendly name is just to aid discovery.
* ```YYYYMMDD```: Replace with the date of the sig-network meeting that accepted the RFC.
* ```X``` is a counter for the day, if there are multiple RFCs accepted in a single meeting.
