# Sig-Network RFCs
This is where RFCs that have been accepted are kept

## RFC Naming
All rfcs follow the pattern of:

```rfc-net-(YYYYMMDD)-(X)-(friendlyname)```

#### Notes
* RFC should be referred to as ```rfc-net-YYYYMMDD-X```, friendly name is to just to aid discovery.
* ```YYYYMMDD```: Replace with the date of the sig-network meeting that accepted the RFC.
* ```X``` is a counter for the day, if there are multiple RFCs accepted in a single meeting.
