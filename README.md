# Open 3D Engine Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG Network)

This repository holds materials for the Open 3D Engine Foundation Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG-Network).

## Description of SIG Network
We manage communication components for O3DE, including foundational networking layers, transport, multiplayer, client/server interactions and Cloud connectivity pieces of O3DE. See the [SIG's charter](governance/SIG%20Network%20Charter.md) for full details.

## What the SIG does:

* Reviews and contribute to O3DE's technology roadmap specifically around Networking features. 
* Reviews network related issues, RFCs and PRs. 
* Ensures timely and frequent communication of networking activities (including Discord, sig meetings, triage, PR review, RFCs, etc.)
* Actively maintains networking features.
* Provides support to community for networking topics.
* Works with other SIGs and the TSC on networking related features and issues that are impactful.

## How do I get involved?

* Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/o3de). The SIG has a specific chat channel **#sig-network**.
* Attend any of our public meetings by connecting to the **#sig-network** voice channel on O3DE's Discord server. See the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar) for upcoming meetings and details.
    * The SIG hosts a general meeting once a month, on the third Thursday of the month, to discuss networking features, recently contributed work, pending RFCs, and other items of interest to the SIG. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Network Meeting** on O3DE calendar. [Meeting agendas](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amtg-agenda) are posted in advanced as GitHub issues and anyone can raise issues for discussion.
    * The SIG also meets once per week, on Thursdays, to review any new issues of interest to the SIG. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Network Issue Triage** and see the [Triage Guide](TRIAGE_GUIDE.md) for more details of what happens at this meeting.
* Subscribe to our [mailing list](https://lists.o3de.org/g/sig-network/join), which is occasionally used to convey information of interest to SIG members.

### Who can attend or participate?
O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #sig-network channel on O3DE Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
