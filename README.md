# Open 3D Engine Special Interest Group on Networking

This repoistory holds materials for the Open 3D Engine Foundation Special Interest Group for Networking (SIG-Network).

We manage the networking components for O3DE including foundational networking layers, transport, Multiplayer, client/server interactions and Cloud connectivity pieces of O3DE. See the [SIG's charter](governance/SIG%20Network%20Charter.md) for further details.

## How do I get involved?

You can:
* Participate in the SIG Chat channel, **#sig-network** on O3DE's [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/o3de)
* Attend any of our public meetings by connecting to the **#sig-network** voice channel on O3DE's Discord server. See the [O3DE Calendar](https://lists.o3de.org/g/o3de-calendar/calendar) for upcoming meetings and details.
    * The SIG hosts a general public meeting once a month, on the third Thursday of the month, to discuss work completed, items of note to the SIG, pending RFCs and other related items. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Network Meeting** on O3DE calendar. [Meeting agendas](https://github.com/o3de/sig-network/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amtg-agenda) are posted in advanced as GitHub issues and anyone can raise issues for discussion.
    * The SIG also meets once per week, on Thursdays, to review any new issues of interest to the SIG. Look for the meeting titled **SIG-Network Issue Triage** and see the [Triage Guide](TRIAGE_GUIDE.md) for more details of what happens at this meeting meeting.

### Who can Attend or Participate?

O3DE cannot work without the help and input from as many of its community members as possible. You do not need anyoneâ€™s permission to get involved and contribute to the project. The #sig-network channel on O3DE Discord is a great place to begin getting involved. Many of our community members regularly share ideas, updates, and resources there. You can also find a number of topics under the GitHub Discussions area which need your input.
